# APCSA Freedom Project
by **Benjamin Chau**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for AP Computer Science A is a year-long project all about making anything using technology.

For my project, I chose to independently study **Godot** in order to help me make a game on **City simulation**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The game can be a personal entertainment for **individuals**
* Has some historical aspects therefore teaches us about some **cultures** of early America during its colonial era
* Our game is free and therefore **financially** available for anybody
##### CONS
* May promote an **environment** of addiction
* Not good for **school systems** because the product can distract students
* Not good for **jobs** as it can be too addictive
