## **Context**:
In this project, I will be makeing a civilization or city-building simulator game with my Zixuan Yu and William Zheng. The tools that we've testing with to see the best fit to use for the project are [Unity](https://unity.com/) and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). These tools support [C#](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php), a programming language I plan to use for the project.             

## **Content**:

#### **Tinker #1**:

I tried out C# by following the instructions to download it on [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/index.php). Now, I am able to have a codespace to experiment with C#. I started with simple code that seems similar to java so that I can connect it to my experiences in java during the school year.


Created a codespace by following the instructions on Get Started section and got this:
```C#
namespace HelloWorld
{
    internal class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        }
    }
}
```
Tried to replicate what w3school shows by copying `Console.WriteLine(Value);` but showed error and told me to declare a value to output it:
```C#
namespace HelloWorld
{
    internal class Program
    {
        private const string Value = "Hi";

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(Value);
        }
    }
}
```
Notes so far:
* `Console.WriteLine();` is like `System.out.println();`
* C# is very similar to java since it is object-oriented

## **EDP**:

I'm currently on the first step of the engineering design process. This is where I define the problem my project will strive to solve. The problem that my team is planning to solve is improving decision-making because it can be vital when times get stressful which is why we aim to pressure the user to make choices through having random events popup. Our game will require a lot of critical thinking on a timely matter which causes the thrill of it. 

## **Skills**:

Some skills I have grasped during this phase of the project are **how to learn** and **growth mindset**. Learning C# felt like learning a whole new language on top of Java in class; having to do it on my own meant that I have no guidance. However, this meant freedom from grades so I can keep failing and trying without hesitation. Therefore, I embraced learning C# by digesting it little by little and relating it back to Java which is how I practiced **how to learn** a new coding language.
