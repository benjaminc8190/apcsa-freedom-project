# Entry 3

## **Context**:
Before the Winter Break, my partners and I brainstormed many plans for our project to do over the break and learn more about our tool. After so many changes to our original ideas and plans to find a promising solution that's feasible and manageable for us to do. Although we weren't able to complete all our goals, we were able to adjust for our short time we had in the week to further progress our project. We were able to have the camera follow the player as the player moves around and instantiate setting a base for building "buildings."


Throughout the past few weeks since the last blog, I have been working on sharpening my skills with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), which I have locked in on as my tool, to prepare for the city-building civilization game where I adjusted to use GDScript instead of C#. As I learned my tool, I used a [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8lMTwSRoRg&t=2496s) to help me get started with world generation. Although it guided me through making a platformer game, I still learned a lot such as how to import [assets/arts packs](https://ansimuz.itch.io/sunny-land-pixel-game-art) and use them in my game.

## **What I have been doing in the past few weeks since 12/11/24**:

## **Plan**:
* Start the project by creating a repository that allows every member to contribute locally
* Make sure that there is a working menu to start the game
* Have at least some start to a world map

## **EDP**:

I am on the fourth step of the engineering design process as I plan the most promising solution for my game as I narrow down on what features I would like to add. 
This is currently the second step of the engineering design process where I research the problem. After going through playing through some strategy, decision-impacting, and time-senstive games such as Hearts of Iron 4, Frost Punk 2, Clash of Clans, and Bloons TD6. Going through these favorite games of mine with a new lens of examination, I start planning on how I will be able toimplment some of their features I would love to have and gave me inspiration how I want the world to look like. This leads me into the next step of the engineering design process where I will brainstorm these ideas to prioritize which will be part of my MVP(minimal viable product) and which will be beyond it. However, setting a goal to get started with main world should be the main focus as I head into Winter Break.


## **Skills**:

Some skills that I have picked up while doing the first mini-project were **problem decomposition** and **time management** they worked well with each other since I had to break down the mini-project into separate parts while setting aside a short amount of time every week to make progress. I broke down the mini-project into first starting the world, then adding "assets" which are the sprites, and lastly animation in order to understand basic elements of Godot.
