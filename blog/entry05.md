# Entry 5
##### 4/22/25

## **Context**:
We have been trying to keep on track with our plans, although some modifications had to be made. Our goal for a menu of items was somewhat completed since we have it created and has appeared on some occasions. In our next weeks, I will continue to work on it to make sure that it will appear properly when the user interacts with it. Also, my partners have been working hard to implement a tile map for our world creation and the progress seems to be looking good. For the menu, I used the [Pop-up menu node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxRKqdu34M) from Godot and I watch about [Tilemaps for Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZutpG0_CYrQ&t=274s) to help with the world creation.

## Progress in the project:

## **EDP**:
We are currently developing the protoype, our project, which is the fifth step of the Engineering Design Process. I have completed some parts of the plan for my project such as creating a menu for the user to see the buildings. In the upcoming weeks, I will continue to develop the game for placing the buildings down since I am currently waiting on the building designs and tilemap for the holistic world for the game. When finished, our game will be tested by our peers to ensure that there are no bugs that we overlooked which is the sixth step of the EDP.

## **Skills**:
I have continued to develop **how to learn** and **organization** throughout the fifth step of the engineering design process. I learned the concept of knowledge and application since now that I'm am doing the project, I must put my knowledge into practice and identify any knowledge gaps to continue developing the project. For example, I did not know that popup menus existed in Godot nor did I understood how it worked. That's why a quick video on the [Pop-up menu node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxRKqdu34M) helped me understand that they can be a scene that appears as a function when the user does an action. While reviewing concepts that I have learned such as instantiating, I have found the importance in organzing my notes. This is due to the fact that I was able to relearn instantiating faster than when I first learned it. As a result, I was able to make the popup menu by using the `.instantiate()` method for replicating the scene onto the map for the user to see.
