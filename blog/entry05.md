# Entry 5
##### 4/22/25

## **Context**:
During the Spring Break, my partners and I have been working diligently to have a finalized "barebone" of the project since the deadline for the Minimum Viable Product(MVP) was on 4/21/25. As we worked on the final features that we wanted in our game, we looked back into [control nodes for pop-up menus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hog6a0EYa0&t=440s) for the characteristics of buildings from our previous main menu. Since our plans were set, we mainly had to deal with implementing the features such as a population and wood resource as the "currency" of the game so far. As a "barebone" we also had to make sure there were little to no bugs and crashes which is why we left miniature details out such as the player walking through trees and random invisible blocks where the player cannot move through.

## Progress in the project:

### Lumberyard & Menu:

### Reshaping Main Menu:

## **EDP**:
We are currently developing the protoype, our project, which is the fifth step of the Engineering Design Process. I have completed some parts of the plan for my project such as creating a menu for the user to see the buildings. In the upcoming weeks, I will continue to develop the game for placing the buildings down since I am currently waiting on the building designs and tilemap for the holistic world for the game. When finished, our game will be tested by our peers to ensure that there are no bugs that we overlooked which is the sixth step of the EDP.

## **Skills**:
I have continued to develop **how to learn** and **organization** throughout the fifth step of the engineering design process. I learned the concept of knowledge and application since now that I'm am doing the project, I must put my knowledge into practice and identify any knowledge gaps to continue developing the project. For example, I did not know that popup menus existed in Godot nor did I understood how it worked. That's why a quick video on the [Pop-up menu node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxRKqdu34M) helped me understand that they can be a scene that appears as a function when the user does an action. While reviewing concepts that I have learned such as instantiating, I have found the importance in organzing my notes. This is due to the fact that I was able to relearn instantiating faster than when I first learned it. As a result, I was able to make the popup menu by using the `.instantiate()` method for replicating the scene onto the map for the user to see.
