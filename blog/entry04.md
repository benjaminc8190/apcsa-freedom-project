## **Context**:
We have been trying to keep on track with our plans, although some modifications had to be made. Our goal for a menu of items was somewhat completed since we have it created and has appeared on some occasions. In our next weeks, I will continue to work on it to make sure that it will appear properly when the user interacts with it. Also, my partners have been working hard to implement a tile map for our world creation and the progress seems to be looking good. For the menu, I used the [Pop-up menu node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESxRKqdu34M) from Godot and I watch about [Tilemaps for Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZutpG0_CYrQ&t=274s) to help with the world creation.

## **EDP**:

I am on the fourth step of the engineering design process(EDP) as I plan the most promising solution for my game as I narrow down on what features I would like to add for the game. So far we have already implemented some features such as instantiating for buidling buildings. We are still planning out what features we want in our game to fully resonate with our ideals for historical focus. Our idea of MVP has been very shaky due to many changes in the plans to adjust for our tight work schedule. I cannot plan to do much for the upcoming midwinter since I will be going to vacation and I will have a lot of work to catch up on from the senior trip so our plans will most likely change again. However, we are coming close to the fifth step of the engineering design process where we create the prototype, which is our game. 

## **Skills**:

Some skills that I have picked up during the fourth step of the EDP were **how to learn** and **organization** from managing the plans of the project and finding youtube videos to learn specific features I want to add. While doing this project, I am learning more about myself and how I take in information. I felt that I learned more from listening to youtube videos in my free time rather than reading the documentaries and articles from online. That's why I watched a lot of videos for this project such as [how to get input for Godot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05OixHPbxNA&t=68s), [instantiating objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qs8oSGmhx-U&t=2s), and [how to use Github Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ-CJIYPFMI&t=57s). Also, I have been trying to organize what we need/want in the project for a feasible MVP that we can commit. As this is our senior year, there are many acitivies that I want to participate in and have a lot to do due to multiple AP classes. Therefore, I have been working hard to organize our ideas into categories of how much we need or just simply want for fun.
