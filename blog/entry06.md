## **Context**:

Our product, the MVP(minimum viable product), has been finalize after months of working on it. There is still so much more we wanted to add such as a progression feature for the player to gain population and a more readble user interface, but now we have to prepare for an expo and presentation for the project. Therefore, to get our product functional with minimal bugs during our pitch at the expo and presentation, we must have our peers give us feedback.

## Takeaways from giving your Expo elevator pitch
## Takeaways from giving your in-class presentation



## **Future prospects**:
* Tree removal for player expansion
* More buildings for more resources: farms, mines 
* Population increase and decrease systems/features
* Shop/Merchant near the shore to trade for food
* Notification system that notifies the player of events
* Remove buildings feature (DONE)

## **EDP**:
After establishing an MVP for step 5 of the engineering design process, we are still on steps 6 and 7. These two steps are testing and evaluating our product then improving our product based on the results. This is still before the expo, which is next week, and the presentation, which already happened. Our upcoming, fast approaching, step is 8. This last step is to articulate our product meaning through presentations and voicing it as an elevator pitch at the expo.

## **Skills**:
While coding alongside my partners for 3 dayss straight during the break, we had to adapt to each other's lifestyle such as sleep schedule. As a result, I developed the skills **Collaboration** and **Consideration**. When creating our project, we had to think about the intent for why we created the project, an educational game, in reflection to the colonial era of America. We had to discuss with each other how we want our website to convey to the player and make agreements on what time we have left to create our brilliant ideas.
