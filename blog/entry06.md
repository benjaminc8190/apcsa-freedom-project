# Entry 6
##### 5/23/25

## **Context**:

Our product, the MVP(minimum viable product), has been finalize after months of working on it. There is still so much more we wanted to add such as a progression feature for the player to gain population and a more readble user interface, but now we have to prepare for an expo and presentation for the project. Therefore, to get our product functional with minimal bugs during our pitch at the expo and presentation, we must have our peers give us feedback. 

Content: 
## Takeaways from giving your Expo elevator pitch

* No expo yet

## Takeaways from giving your in-class presentation

* I felt like I was looking at the screen too much when I was doing the demo
* When I'm not speaking, I should look at the audience rather than facing my partner that is speaking
* Have a wamrm-up(Ex: Tongue Twister) before speaking to have a better voice and presence when speaking
* Present and look at a camera to see how I am maintaining eye contact during presentation

## **Future prospects for game**:
* Tree removal for player expansion
* More buildings for more resources: farms, mines 
* Population increase and decrease systems/features
* Shop/Merchant near the shore to trade for food
* Notification system that notifies the player of events
* Remove buildings feature (DONE)

## **EDP**:
After establishing an MVP for step 5 of the engineering design process, we are still on steps 6 and 7. These two steps are testing and evaluating our product then improving our product based on the results. This is still before the expo, which is next week, and the presentation, which already happened. Our upcoming, fast approaching, step is 8. This last step is to articulate our product meaning through presentations and voicing it as an elevator pitch at the expo.

## **Skills**:
Developing the skills **consideration** and **communication** was somewhat difficult in step 8. We had very few ideas to articulate to our audience since our game felt small with so many going on in the backend. There was so much more that we wanted to add, but we ended up losing out on time. Also, we had to start considering the impacts our game will have in our community; since it is a game, there would be little impact, just a distraction for attracting people to play.
