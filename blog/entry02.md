## **Context**:
Throughout the past few weeks since the last blog, I have been working on sharpening my skills with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/), which Ihave locked in on as my tool, to prepare for the city-building civilization game where I adjusted to use GDScript instead of C#. As I learned my tool, I used

## **EDP**:

This is currently the second step of the engineering design process where I research the problem. After going through playing through some strategy, indeterministic, and time-senstive games such as Hearts of Iron 4, Frost Punk 2, Clash of Clans, and Bloons TD6. Going through these favorite games of mine with a new lens of examination, I start planning on how I will be able toimplment some of their features I would love to have and gave me inspiration how I want the world to look like. This leads me into the next step of the engineering design process where I will brainstorm these ideas to prioritize which will be part of my MVP(minimal viable product) and which will be beyond it. However, setting a goal to get started with main world should be the main focus as I head into Winter Break.
